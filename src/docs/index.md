**`somos-py`** is a [Somos sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somos_sequence) generator for Python.

## Somos sequences

**Somos sequences** are a series of mathematical sequences generated by a recurrence equation, like the Fibonacci numbers.

They were first described by Michael Somos in September 1989 as [Problem 1470](https://cms.math.ca/wp-content/uploads/crux-pdfs/Crux_v15n07_Sep.pdf#page=19) in [*Crux Mathematicorum* Volume 15, Issue 7](https://cms.math.ca/wp-content/uploads/crux-pdfs/Crux_v15n07_Sep.pdf) and then later in his paper "[Step into the Elliptic Realm](https://www.cut-the-knot.org/arithmetic/algebra/EllipticSeq.shtml)" in January 2000.

### Definition
For an integer $k$ larger than 1, the Somos-$k$ sequence is defined by the equation:

$$a_{n}a_{{n-k}}=a_{{n-1}}a_{{n-k+1}}+a_{{n-2}}a_{{n-k+2}}+\cdots +a_{{n-(k-1)/2}}a_{{n-(k+1)/2}}$$

when $k$ is odd; or

$$a_{n}a_{{n-k}}=a_{{n-1}}a_{{n-k+1}}+a_{{n-2}}a_{{n-k+2}}+\cdots +(a_{{n-k/2}})^{2}$$

when $k$ is even, with the initial values $a_{i}=1$ for $i < k$.

### Sequence values
For $k = 2$ or $3$, the generated sequence is all $1$s.

For $k > 3$, the first $k$ terms are all $1$s.

For $k < 7$, all terms are integers. For $k > 8$, terms will eventually become fractions. The terms at which Somos-$k$ becomes non-integral are (starting at Somos-$8$): 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 27, 28, 30, 33, 34, 36, 39, ... (sequence [A030127](https://oeis.org/A030127) in the OEIS).

Below are the first 20 terms of Somos sequences 4 to 10.

### In popular culture
**Somos sequences** were discussed by [Dr Harini Desiraju](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/harini-desiraju.html), a fellow at the University of Syndey, in a [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/@numberphile) video from May 2022.

## Uses
None, really. This is just a small implementation of a bit of number theory. It's purely recreational. :)
